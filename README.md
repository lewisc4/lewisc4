#### I am currently pursuing my master's degree in computer science at the [University of Massachusetts Lowell](https://www.uml.edu/) and I am expected to graduate in May 2023. I am interested in Machine Learning/AI and currently seeking a position in this field. I am particularly interested in the applications of deep learning in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision.

#### Here are some of my highlighted machine learning-related projects:
  - [**`Mental Health Disorder Classifier`**](https://github.com/lewisc4/Mental-Health-Disorder-Classifier) â€” *Graph Machine Learning* **|** *Natural Language Processing*
    - Scraped Reddit data using the Pushshift API and Googleâ€™s BigQuery to build a user-comment network
    - Implemented novel methods for identifying self-reported user diagnoses
    - Applied data preprocessing techniques to the dataset and performed feature extraction
    - Trained and evaluated multiple graph-based models using GraphSAGE, GCN, and GAT
  - [**`Facial Expression Recognition`**](https://github.com/lewisc4/Emotion-Detection) â€” *Deep Learning* **|** *Computer Vision*
    - Harnessed PyTorchâ€™s GPU support to create a facial expression recognition image model
    - Achieved near state-of-the-art performance using limited computational resources
    - Fine-tuned and evaluated multiple pre-trained ResNet models on the FER2013 dataset
  - [**`SQL-To-Text Translator`**](https://github.com/lewisc4/SQL-To-Text) â€” *Deep Learning* **|** *Natural Language Processing*
    - Developed a SQL-to-text translation model using PyTorchâ€™s GPU capabilities
    - Outperformed all baseline models, while also using less GPU-related resources
    - Utilized the WikiSQL dataset to fine-tune a Microsoft CodeT5 model
    - Assessed the viability of the model using automated metrics and human evaluation
  - [**`Song Genre Classifier`**](https://github.com/lewisc4/Song-Genre-Predictor) â€” *Machine Learning* **|** *Natural Language Processing*
    - Developed Python scripts to scrape song lyrics and apply machine learning techniques to predict their genre
    - Implemented PySpark to improve overall performance using its cluster-computing capabilities
    - Analyzed the accuracies of three machine learning models using the scikit-learn Python library
