## About Me
Masterâ€™s in CS from [UML](https://www.uml.edu/) (machine learning focus). I like deep learning + NLP, solving problems, and making code faster.

Having fun with SQL and Python at [Vestmark](https://www.vestmark.com/). Re-learning C (the GOAT).

## Projects (VERY Outdated)
In hindsight, it's funny how ChatGPT et al. can replace these directly or build them in seconds. That said, they're fun and I learned a lot. IMO, you can't learn without doing.

- [iMessage GPT](https://github.com/lewisc4/imessaGPT): A language model built with PyTorch and HuggingFace.
- [Mental Health Disorder Classifier](https://github.com/lewisc4/Mental-Health-Disorder-Classifier): A graph-based classifier using TensorFlow and StellarGraph.
- [Facial Expression Recognition](https://github.com/lewisc4/Emotion-Detection): Classifying expressions in images with PyTorch.
- [SQL-To-Text Translator](https://github.com/lewisc4/SQL-To-Text): Translating SQL queries into plain English.
- [Medical Image Classifier](https://github.com/lewisc4/MedicalMNIST): Classifying medical images using PyTorch.
- [Song Genre Classifier](https://github.com/lewisc4/Song-Genre-Predictor): Predicting song genres using simple text analysis.
